# Lana

Graphical logic analyzer. Currently works with csv data that looks like this:

```
Time[s],Channel 0
0.000000000000000,1
1.813367583333333,0
1.814014083333333,1
1.814383916666667,0
1.815033500000000,1
1.815400416666667,0
1.815492333333333,1
```

Each row has the timestamp of the state change in the first column and the logic state in the second column. Since each row is a state change it just alternates one zero one zero one zero and so on.

Lana graphs two lines per state change (csv row) â”˜

The horizontal line starts at the x/y coordinates where the previous state changed ends (where x is time and y is state) and ends at the new x coordinate and the previous y coordinate. The vertical line then goes from the that x and y coordinate to the same x and the new y coordinate representing the state change. Explained in code that would be:

```javascript
// horizontal line
[x1, y1, x2, y1]
// vertical line
[x2, y1, x2, y2]
```

The csv data above was exported from the app Logic by [Saleae](https://www.saleae.com/). I have a Saleae  Logic 4 and I love it. Well built and easy to use hardware and software for recording and analyzing analog and digital signals. I highly recommend buying one.

Named after [Lana the research chimpanzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_(chimpanzee)) and short for logic analyzer.

Lana doesn't really do much yet so I recommend checking out [Sigrok](http://sigrok.org/) and [Pulseview](https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView) if you want to get any real work done.

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jonmagic/lana
$ cd lana
$ npm install && npm start
```

Click the **Open** button and choose a csv file to open. You can find the `hello_world.csv` sample in the samples directory.

## Goals

- [x] Visualize csv in timestamp/state change format
- [ ] Zoom
- [ ] Auto-scaling timestamp markers in graph
- [ ] Hover over to get exact distances between state changes, duty cycle, etc
- [ ] First logic analyzer. Use hello_world.csv as example, should look something like [this](http://cl.ly/1f0u3l0P3q0v) and [this](http://cl.ly/1x0N2F2P2h17)
